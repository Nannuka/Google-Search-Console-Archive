### Beta ###

This tool is in Beta, but we use it a lot in a daily basis and are comfortable enough with the stability and features to release it.

## Requirements ##
- MySQL Server (5+)
- Nginx or Apache with PHP (5.3+, may be compatible with previous versions)
- Access to Cron

## Configuration ##

### Creating a Google Service Account ###

Follow the instructions to Create a Service Account
(See https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/auth/service-accounts#creatinganaccount)

- Generate & download a p12 Key for your account
- Put the P12 key in the configuration folder

### Adding Service Account to Google Search Console ###

- Open [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters)
- Select your website
- Click on the top right menu and select **Users & Property Owner**
- Select **Add a new user**
- Add the Service Account email and keep the **Restricted** permission
- Click on **Add**

### Script configuration ###

Rename *configuration/base.php.sample* to *configuration/base.php*

Edit *base.php* and fill/replace the following :
- [Timezone](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php) & locale
- Api Login
- Websites to check (Add http:// or https:// before your website DNS)

    ```php
    'websites' => array(
        'blog.elijaa.org' => array(
            'url' => 'http://blog.elijaa.org',
            'table' => 'blog.elijaa.org')),
    ```

- Database configuration (Hostname, password, port, database name)


### Database configuration ###

You will need a MySQL database for Search Console Archive AND a user granted for CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- Open *docs/sql/website.sql*, replace the {%website_table%} token with your website's table name
(The ['table'] key used in the website array in the configuration file)
- Run the SQL code to in your MySQL Database to create base tables for every website you want to add
- Open *docs/sql/filters.sql*, replace the {%website%} token with your website name
- Run the SQL code to in your MySQL Database to create base filters

### Data Import configuration ###

You need to run cron.php everyday once, it will take by default the last 7 days of data available.

You can pass a integer parameter to specify the number of day from now() to retreive

Don't forget that Search Console data is not up to date, you have a 3-5 day delay, more some times, check this page for explanation/missing data : https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6211453#search_analytics

!! **For the first run, put 90 days in the first run to import all available history**

    php cron.php 90

You need to do the same (Adjust the time) everytime Google Search Console Data is missing

In a normal use, use the default parameter

## Filters ##

Filters are shortcut to saved search/filters, the docs/sql/filters.sql file contain two sample

Actually there is no way to add/modify them in the tool, only in the database.

    INSERT INTO `filters`
    (`name`,
    `query`,
    `value`,
    `website`)
    VALUES
    (<{name: }>,
    <{query: }>,
    <{value: }>,
    <{website: }>);

- name : name of the filter
- query : page/query
- value : the filter value, like *^/$* for your homepage or *memcache -php* for the *memcache* keyword but not associated with the *php* keyword
- website : the website shortcut name

Future version will add a nice filter handling

## Google API PHP Client ##
Search Console Archive use [Google APIs Client Library for PHP](https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client) to query Google API

It should be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org). Use the command:

    composer update

Be sure to keep Google API PHP Client at version 1.*
